# Emulator Developer Guide

The developer guide is an essential document that describes the design of your code for future developers who may need to extend, optimize, or fix bugs in the codebase. This guide assumes that you are no longer available to offer assistance to future engineers, so it should be comprehensive and easy to understand.

Please modify this template `dev-guide.md` file to create your own developer guide. Make sure to follow the instructions provided and refer to the [Markdown Guide Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for Markdown syntax.

## Introduction

[Provide a brief introduction to the emulator codebase and its purpose.]

## Code Structure

[Describe the overall structure of the codebase, including the main modules, classes, or components used.]

## Component Mapping

[Explain the mapping of design components to the corresponding source code components. Provide an overview of how different parts of the codebase relate to the design.]

## Key Functions

[Describe the key functions or operations of the emulator code. Explain how they work and their importance in the overall functionality.]

## Extending the Code

[Provide guidance on how to extend the codebase for adding new features or functionality. Include best practices, guidelines, and examples.]

## Optimizing Performance

[Discuss techniques or considerations for optimizing the performance of the codebase. Provide recommendations on efficient algorithms, data structures, or design patterns.]

## Bug Fixes

[Describe the process for identifying and fixing bugs in the codebase. Provide guidelines for debugging, testing, and submitting bug fixes.]
