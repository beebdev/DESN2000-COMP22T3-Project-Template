The user guide is a critical component of your emulator project, as it provides instructions for the QA team to set up, operate, and troubleshoot the emulator independently, without assistance from the development team. This guide should be comprehensive, clear, and easy to follow, and it should include step-by-step instructions for all key functions.

Please modify this template `user-guide.md` file to create your own user guide. Make sure to follow the instructions provided and refer to the [Markdown Guide Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for Markdown syntax.

As mentioned in the user guide specifications, **this guide will need to be submitted as a pdf**. You can use any markdown to PDF conversion methods. If you are unsure which, I recommend the Markdown PDF extension in vscode.

**Markdown PDF VSCode extension**:
1. Install the "*Markdown PDF*" extension in vscode ([link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf))
2. When your markdown file is opened, right-click and select "*Markdown PDF: Export (pdf)*"
