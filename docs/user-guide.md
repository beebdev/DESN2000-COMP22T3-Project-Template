# Emulator User Guide

The user guide is a critical component of your emulator project, as it provides instructions for the QA team to set up, operate, and troubleshoot the emulator independently, without assistance from the development team. This guide should be comprehensive, clear, and easy to follow, and it should include step-by-step instructions for all key functions.

Please modify this template `user-guide.md` file to create your own user guide. Make sure to follow the instructions provided and refer to the [Markdown Guide Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for Markdown syntax.
